# PLAN

## Brainstorming

* put agent in box and move randomly (done) we cant teach stuff yet
* maybe make the box a maze it learns to solve then back to box put a treat so it somehow finds treats?
* need to tell it where the treats, traps, are so that it knows them and compare results to qdata it already has else it explores
* to set spawn point have random spawns for treats and run episodes to those treats (fixed for now) add epsiode loops

## Episode Setup

1. SPAWN JERRY
2. SPAWN CHEESE 
3. SPAWN TRAP 
4. TELL JERRY WHERE THE TRAP AND CHEESE ARE 
5. JERRY HAS TO MOVE TO THE CHEESE WHILE AVOIDING THE TRAP 
6. JERRY GETS REWARDED +1 WHEN GET TREAT 
7. JERRY LOOSES -0.01 FOR EVERY STEP
